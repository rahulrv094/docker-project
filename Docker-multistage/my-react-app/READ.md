# 🧩 React App with Docker — Multi-stage vs Single-stage Build

This project demonstrates how to containerize a React application using Docker with:

- ✅ **Multi-stage build (with Nginx)** — recommended for production
- ⚠️ **Single-stage build (with Node + serve)** — simple but heavier

## 🚀 How to Run with Docker

### Step 1: Build Image

#### 🏗️ Multi-stage build

```bash
docker build -t react-app-multi-stage .
````

#### 🪓 Single-stage build

```bash
docker build -t react-app-single-stage -f Dockerfile.single .
```

---

### Step 2: Run Container

#### 🔥 Multi-stage (Nginx)

```bash
docker run -p 8080:80 react-app-multi-stage
```

Visit: [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

#### 🐢 Single-stage (Node + Serve)

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 react-app-single-stage
```

Visit: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

---

## 📦 Dockerfile: Multi-stage (Recommended)

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build React app
FROM node:18-alpine as build

WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve with Nginx
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

✅ **Pros:**

* Small image size (\~30–50 MB)
* Secure and fast for production
* Nginx efficiently serves static files

---

## 🐳 Dockerfile.single: Single-stage with Node

```dockerfile
FROM node:18-alpine

WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN npm install
RUN npm run build
RUN npm install -g serve

EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["serve", "-s", "build"]
```

⚠️ **Cons:**

* Larger image (\~300–600 MB)
* Includes unnecessary dev tools in final image
* Slower startup

✅ **Pros:**

* Simpler for development
* Doesn’t need Nginx

## 🧠 Why Multi-stage is Better?

| Feature                    | Multi-stage (Nginx)      | Single-stage (Node)    |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------ | ---------------------- |
| Image Size                 | ✅ Small (\~30 MB)        | ❌ Large (\~300 MB+)    |
| Security                   | ✅ Minimal attack surface | ❌ Exposes Node runtime |
| Build Tools in Final Image | ❌ No                     | ✅ Yes (not ideal)      |
| Production Ready           | ✅ Yes                    | ❌ Not ideal            |

---

## 🔧 Requirements

* Docker installed and running
* No need for local Node.js or npm

---

## 📝 Scripts (from package.json)

```json
"scripts": {
  "start": "react-scripts start",       // Dev server
  "build": "react-scripts build",       // Create production build
  "test": "react-scripts test",
  "eject": "react-scripts eject"
}
```

---

## 💬 Final Thoughts

* Use **multi-stage builds** for production deployments (faster, smaller, more secure)
* Use **single-stage with `serve`** only for development or quick testing
* Docker lets you containerize apps even without having Node.js locally
