## **Phase 5: Advanced Docker**

---

## ✅ **1. Multi-Stage Docker Builds**

### 🔹 What is it?

In a **multi-stage build**, you define multiple `FROM` instructions in your Dockerfile. Each `FROM` creates a new stage.
You use earlier stages to **compile/build** code and the last stage to **create a small, clean final image**.

This is useful to:

* Avoid shipping compilers/build tools in production image
* Reduce image size
* Improve security

### 🔹 Real-World Example (Go app):

```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Builder
FROM golang:1.20 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN go build -o myapp

# Stage 2: Minimal Final Image
FROM alpine:latest
COPY --from=builder /app/myapp /myapp
ENTRYPOINT ["/myapp"]
```

📌 Only the final binary (`myapp`) is copied to a lightweight image.

---

## ✅ **2. Docker Security Basics**

### 🔹 Why is it important?

Containers should be **hardened** to:

* Reduce the attack surface
* Prevent privilege escalation
* Ensure minimal access

### 🔹 Best Practices:

#### ✅ Run as Non-Root User:

```dockerfile
RUN adduser -D appuser
USER appuser
```

> Prevents root-level actions inside the container.

#### ✅ Drop Unnecessary Capabilities:

```bash
docker run --cap-drop=ALL --cap-add=NET_BIND_SERVICE myimage
```

> Only allows binding to ports like 80/443, drops others.

#### ✅ Make Filesystem Read-Only:

```bash
docker run --read-only myimage
```

> Prevents any write on the container filesystem.

#### ✅ Vulnerability Scan:

```bash
docker scan myimage
```

> Scans for known vulnerabilities in image layers.

## ✅ **3. Docker Logging & Monitoring**

### 🔹 Logs in Docker

* View logs of running or stopped container:

```bash
docker logs <container-name>
```

* For real-time streaming logs:

```bash
docker logs -f <container-name>
```

### 🔹 Log Drivers

Docker supports multiple **log drivers**:

| Driver    | Use Case                       |
| --------- | ------------------------------ |
| json-file | Default on most systems        |
| syslog    | Sends logs to syslog daemon    |
| journald  | Systemd integration            |
| fluentd   | For centralized log collectors |
| awslogs   | Logs to AWS CloudWatch         |

Change log driver:

```bash
docker run --log-driver=syslog myimage
```

### 🔹 Monitoring with Prometheus

* Expose metrics from apps (`/metrics` endpoint)
* Use `cadvisor` to monitor container metrics
* Visualize using **Grafana**

> Optional setup can be shared if you want to try it.

## ✅ **4. Docker Swarm (Optional)**

### 🔹 What is Docker Swarm?

Swarm is Docker’s **native clustering and orchestration tool** (like Kubernetes, but simpler).

It lets you:

* Manage multiple Docker hosts
* Deploy services
* Ensure high availability

### 🔹 Key Commands:

```bash
docker swarm init
docker service create --name web -p 80:80 nginx
docker service ls
docker service ps web
```

### 🔹 Why it's optional:

* Not widely used in production now
* Most teams use Kubernetes instead

---

## ✅ **5. Docker with CI/CD Pipelines**

### 🔹 Why use Docker in CI?

* Standardized build environments
* Avoids “it works on my machine”
* Easily deployable images

### 🔹 Example: GitHub Actions Workflow

```yaml
name: Build & Push Docker Image

on: [push]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v2
      
      - name: Build Docker Image
        run: docker build -t myimage:latest .

      - name: Push to DockerHub
        run: |
          echo "${{ secrets.DOCKER_PASSWORD }}" | docker login -u "${{ secrets.DOCKER_USERNAME }}" --password-stdin
          docker push myimage:latest
```

✅ Store DockerHub username/password in GitHub secrets.

---

## ✅ **6. Docker with Kubernetes (Intro)**

### 🔹 Using Docker images in Kubernetes:

When you build a Docker image, Kubernetes can use it in Pods.

### 🔹 Example: Pod definition using custom Docker image

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: myapp
spec:
  containers:
    - name: app
      image: myimage:latest
      ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### 🔹 Deploy to cluster:

```bash
kubectl apply -f pod.yaml
```

✅ This is the basic building block of Kubernetes workloads.

## ✅ Summary (Cheat Sheet Style):

| Topic                  | Key Command / Tip                         |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Multi-Stage Build      | `COPY --from=builder` in Dockerfile       |
| Run as Non-root        | `USER appuser` in Dockerfile              |
| Drop Capabilities      | `--cap-drop=ALL`                          |
| Logs                   | `docker logs -f container_name`           |
| CI/CD                  | `docker build` + `docker push` in CI jobs |
| Kubernetes Integration | Use image in `Pod` or `Deployment` YAML   |
