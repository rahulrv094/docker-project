# üß© Phase 1: Docker Basics

**üéØ Goal:** Understand what Docker is, how it works, and learn basic commands.

---

## üö¢ 1. What is Docker?

### üîπ Simple Definition:

Docker is a open platform for developing, shipping and runnig application. Docker enables you to seprate your application from your infra so you deliver software quickly.

Docker is a **containerization platform**. It lets you package your application along with all its dependencies (libraries, configuration, etc.) into a **container** so it runs reliably in any environment.

> ‚úÖ "Build once, run anywhere."

## üîç 2. Docker vs Virtual Machines

| Feature        | Docker (Container) | Virtual Machine (VM)  |
| -------------- | ------------------ | --------------------- |
| Boot Time      | Few seconds        | Few minutes           |
| Resource Usage | Low (lightweight)  | High (runs entire OS) |
| Isolation      | Process-level      | Full OS-level         |
| Image Size     | Small (MBs)        | Large (GBs)           |
| Portability    | High               | Moderate              |
| Speed          | Fast               | Slow                  |

üëâ Docker uses the **host OS kernel**, which makes it lightweight and faster than VMs.

## ‚öôÔ∏è 3. Docker Architecture

```
+-------------------------+
|     Docker CLI (Client)|
+-----------+-------------+
            |
            v
+-----------+-------------+
|       Docker Daemon     |  (Runs on host)
+-----------+-------------+
            |
            v
+-----------+-------------+
|  Docker Objects:        |
|  Images, Containers,    |
|  Volumes, Networks      |
+-------------------------+
```
Docker follows a clinet servers architecture, where the docker clinet talks to docker daemon (servers) to build, run and manage containers.

The main components are :
 
### 1. **Docker Client**

* This is the command-line tool you use (`docker` command).
* It talks to the Docker daemon (server).
* Example command:

  ```bash
  docker build -t my-app .
  ```

### 2. **Docker Daemon (`dockerd`)**

* Runs in the background on your system.
* It listens for Docker API requests from the client.
* Responsible for managing:

  * Images
  * Containers
  * Networks
  * Volumes

### 3. **Docker Images**

* Read-only templates used to create containers.
* Contain everything needed to run an app (code, dependencies, OS).
* Built from a **Dockerfile**.
* Stored in a **registry** (like Docker Hub).

### 4. **Docker Containers**

* Lightweight, runnable instances of Docker images.
* They are isolated environments for running applications.
* Think of them as small virtual environments without the overhead of full VMs.

### 5. **Dockerfile**

* A text file with instructions to build an image.
* Example:

  ```Dockerfile
  FROM node:18
  WORKDIR /app
  COPY . .
  RUN npm install
  CMD ["npm", "start"]
  ```

### 6. **Docker Registry**

* A repository for Docker images.
* The default public registry is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com).
* You can also use private registries (e.g., AWS ECR, GitHub Container Registry).

### 7. **Docker Compose** *(optional but powerful)*

* A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications using a `docker-compose.yml` file.
* Example:

  ```yaml
  version: "3"
  services:
    web:
      build: .
      ports:
        - "3000:3000"
  ```

## Docker Engine = Docker Daemon + Docker API + Docker CLI
How it works:
You run:
docker run nginx

‚û°Ô∏è The CLI sends this to the API
‚û°Ô∏è The API tells the Daemon
‚û°Ô∏è The Daemon runs the container

---
## What is a Docker Volume?
A Docker volume is a persistent storage mechanism used by Docker to store data outside of a container's lifecycle.

Normally, when a container is deleted, all its data is lost.

Volumes allow you to keep data even after the container is removed.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è 4. Docker Installation

### üîπ For Ubuntu/Debian (if not already installed):

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install docker.io
sudo systemctl enable docker
sudo systemctl start docker
```

---

## ‚úÖ 5. Check Docker Version & Info

```bash
docker --version     # Check Docker version
docker info          # See configuration and environment info
```

---

## üß™ 6. First Docker Command

Run this command to test if Docker is working correctly:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

What it does:

* Pulls the `hello-world` image from Docker Hub (if not present locally)
* Starts a container from the image
* Prints a confirmation message

---

## üìö 7. Important Docker Terms

| Term           | Meaning                                                                 |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Image**      | A template/blueprint used to create containers                          |
| **Container**  | A running instance of an image                                          |
| **Dockerfile** | A file containing instructions to build a custom Docker image           |
| **Volume**     | Storage mechanism to persist data beyond container lifecycle            |
| **Registry**   | A place to store/publish images (Docker Hub, GitHub Container Registry) |

---

## üß∞ 8. Basic Docker Commands to Try

```bash
docker run hello-world        # Run a test container
docker images                 # List downloaded images
docker ps -a                  # List all containers (running + stopped)
```

---

## ‚úÖ Summary of Phase 1

* Docker is a lightweight alternative to VMs.
* Containers package apps with dependencies.
* You interact with Docker via the CLI.
* You pull and run images using `docker run`.
* The `hello-world` container confirms everything works.
